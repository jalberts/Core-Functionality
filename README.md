Core-Functionality
==================

Theme agnostic functionality plugin for WordPress.

Core Functionality Plugin, heavily influenced by Bill Erikson's own [Core Functionality plugin](https://github.com/billerickson/Core-Functionality).

It incorporates the HumanMade branch of [Custom Meta Boxes](https://github.com/humanmade/Custom-Meta-Boxes), rather than to the [original library](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/Custom-Metaboxes-and-Fields-for-WordPress).
